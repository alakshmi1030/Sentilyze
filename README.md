Sentilyze
=========

A fun graphical interface for seeing overall sentiment on a topic. Uses Semantria API to analyze
sentiments of Twitter posts related to search query.

Still to add javascript loading gif on the front-end in between request and response. Also
looking to add more back-end data points for sentiment analysis (potentially Facebook statuses through Graph Search API)
